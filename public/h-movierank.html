<h1>The best movies and series according to Hayden</h1>
<h2>My top 3:</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>
    One of the movies that got me into Linguistics and learning languages in general. Not too much action but thought-provoking.
</p>
<h3>Chernobyl</h3>
<p>
    I have a thing for catastrophic movies/series. I just find them so intriguing to see those "hypothetical" situations happen.
</p>
<h3>Sense8</h3>
<p>
    Phenomenal series. Changed my life in many ways and allowed me to understand the world a little bit better.
